# Dart Sense

## Description
Dart Sense is an automatic dart scoring application. It uses a sophisticated deep learning-based computer vision model to track the landing coordinates of darts and 4 board calibration points in an image in order to predict the scores for each dart. This app can be used to score a game of darts in real time using video streamed from a smartphone.

## Methodology
For this project, open source data from McNally et al. 2021 was used, consisting of ~16,000 images. This data was collected by the authors who played darts and took photos of the board after each throw. D3, D4, and D5 were collected as additional data sets in order to provide a greater variety of data for the object detection model to train on. These images were collected from Youtube videos, allowing for an array of different playing configurations (e.g dart type,
board type, colours, lighting, camera angles) to be sampled.
